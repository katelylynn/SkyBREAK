# SkyBREAK

## About

Through this app, I used Java AWT and Javax to mimic the terminal in the video game, Welcome to the Game (see link).

In this pretend desktop, you can type in the terminal but it does not actually function. This was a small, quick project extending an assignment for my high-school programming 12 class.

## Instructions

- download the SkyBREAK folder
- if zipped, take it out of the zipped folder
- open up command line
- cd to the SkyBREAK folder
- run -> java com.mycompany.katesjavaproj.SkyBREAK
